  - Real-time alarm status indicators
  - Professional startup animation and author credit
- **Advanced Button Handling**:
  - Non-blocking debouncing with 50ms delay
  - Independent state tracking for all 4 buttons
  - Immediate visual feedback for button presses
- **Comprehensive Example Sketches**:
  - `button_test.ino`: Button connection verification
  - `alarm_demo.ino`: Feature demonstration with accelerated time
- **Enhanced Documentation**:
  - Complete V2.0 user manual (`README_V2.md`)
  - Circuit diagrams for V2.0 hardware
  - Troubleshooting guide and customization instructions
  - Migration guide from V1.0 to V2.0

### 🔧 Changed
- **Code Architecture**: Modular function design with separation of concerns
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized variable usage and string handling
- **Display System**: Enhanced LCD management with message prioritization
